First Presentation
Your task is to predict when earnings per share (EPS) in Compustat is positive.  Note that this is a binary outcome.  
Use other accounting variables, using a gradient boosting machine.  You can choose which variable you'd like.  
Note that if you put in enough other variables you can calculate EPS exactly (using net income, for example), which is boring.  
Pick variables that make it interesting.  Use a validation set to tune, and a test set to report overall results.  
There are several different implementations of GBM, like the original GBM package, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.  
You may want to compare some of these for this problem.
